# Building an API using a Node.js and Express

## Topics

* Building RESTful APIs.
* Performing CRUD Operations on Multiple Resources.
* Configuring CORS.
* Writing Custom Middleware.
* Using Express Routers to Modularize Application.

## Assignment

Use Node.js and Express to design and build an API that performs CRUD operations on **users, posts and post tags**. Write custom middleware to ensure that the _tags_ are uppercased before they are processed by the request handlers.

### Download Project Files and Install Dependencies

* **Fork** and **Clone** this repository.
* **CD into the folder** where you cloned the repository.
* Do your magic!

### Implement Requirements

* Take the steps necessary to create a `package.json` to keep a record of our dependencies.
* use _yarn_ or _npm_ to add **knex** and **sqlite3** as dependencies to the project. **This is required for database access**.
* Configure an _npm script_ named _"start"_ that will execute your code using _nodemon_ so that the server restarts on changes. Make _nodemon_ be a development time dependency only, it shouldn't be deployed to production.
* Design and build a set of endpoints that satisfy the API requirements.
* **Use _Postman_ to test the API as you work through the exercises.**

### Database Persistence Helpers

The `/data/helpers` folder includes helper files that you can use to manage the persistence of users, posts and tags data. These files are `userDb.js`, `postDb.js` and `tagDb.js`. All three of them publish the following api, that you can use to store, modify and retrieve each resource:

* `get()`: calling find returns a promise that resolves to an array of all the resources contained in the database. If you pass an `id` to this method it will return the resource with that id if found.
* `insert()`: calling insert passing it a resource object will add it to the database and return an object with the id of the inserted resource. The object looks like this: `{ id: 123 }`.
* `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the resource to update and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. It returns the count of updated records. If the count is 1 it means the record was updated correctly.
* `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as it's first parameter and, upon successfully deleting the resource from the database, returns the number of records deleted.

The `postDb.js` helper includes an extra method called `getPostTags()` that when passed a post id as it's only argument, returns a list of all the _tags_ for the post.

The `userDb.js` helper includes an extra method called `getUserPosts()` that when passed a user id as it's only argument, returns a list of all the posts for the user.

**All these helper methods return a promise.**

#### Database Schemas

The _schemas_ (properties and data type of each property) used to store and retrieve the resources inside the included database (`lambda.sqlite3`) is described below.

##### Users

* id: number, no need to provide it when creating users, the database will generate it.
* name: up to 128 characters long, required.

##### Posts

* id: number, no need to provide it when creating posts, the database will automatically generate it.
* userId: number, required, must be the id of an existing user.
* text: string, no size limit, required.

##### Tags

* id: number, no need to provide it when creating tags, the database will generate it.
* tag: string up to 80 characters long, must be a unique value.

We have provided test data for all the resources.

Now that we have a way to add, update, remove and retrieve data from the provided database, it is time to work on the API.

### Design and Build Endpoints

Design and build the necessary endpoints to:

* perform CRUD operations on _users_, _posts_, and _tags_.
* retrieve the list of posts for a user.
* retrieve the list of tags for a post.

## Stretch Goal

* Use `create-react-app` to create an application inside the root folder, name it `client`.
* From the React application connect to the `/api/users` endpoint in the API and show the list of users.
* Add functionality to show the details of a user, including their posts, when clicking a user name in the list. Use React Router to navigate to a `/users/:id` route to show the user details.
* Add styling!
